Collection of GTK+ chart widgets
--------------------------------

Provides some nice GTK+ chart widgets.  Requires PyGTK_ 2.12 or higher.

At this time, provides just a single widget.  More may come as I scratch
other itches, or as others scratch their own itches and send patches.

``gtkchartlib.RingChart``
  Visualise hierarchical data in concentric circles.

This project was previously named "pygtkchart".  The name was changed
after a project of similar name and purpose was encountered elsewhere.
